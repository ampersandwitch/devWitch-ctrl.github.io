          Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. I want your answer and
          the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. When they come... they come at what you love. It's not personal. It's business.
          I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. That's my family Kay, that's not me. I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!
          What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name? Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited
          me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? This one time, this one time I'll let you ask
          me about my affairs.</p>
